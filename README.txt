Format for running raytracer program is ./Raytracer [size of image] [depth] [antialiasing] [multithreading] [name]

In order to display the different build scenes, comment out different build scenes to include in the void buildScene(void)
function in RayTracer.c, then recompile.
- Only one buildscene should be uncommented at a time, or else wierd things happen
